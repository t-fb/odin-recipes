# odin-recipes
Hello Im Trixy and my first project is making a recipe website. 
Ill be making a main idex page that will link to my favourtie recipes!
Im hoping i can use what ive learned so far to make a simple website! 
Hopefully ill able to demonstrate that i can make a structured site, using links, paragraphs, headers and pictures with recipes under them!
